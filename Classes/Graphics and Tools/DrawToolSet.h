 Sent by the document when it otherwise has no selection to inspect itself. Your toolset may return a "generic" object that it wished to have inspected. For example, the DrawGraphicsToolSet returns the document's templateGraphic, because the template graphic is used for the initial aspect settings on new graphics. By returning the template graphic, the user can change things like fill or stroke settings prior to actually creating a new graphic.
