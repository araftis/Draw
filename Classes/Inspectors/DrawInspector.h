 Provided the object from the inspector controller's selection, this returns the actual object inspected. For example, a graphic inspector would just return object, while an aspect inspector, such as the stroke inspector, would return the graphic's first stroke aspect.
 
 Note that object can be of any type that the inspector claims to inspect. This is important because something like an aspect inspector could be provided a DrawAspect or a DrawGraphic.
 
 @param object The object in the selection. It could be of any type the inspector claims to inspect.
 @param creationCallback If not NULL, then the callback will be called if the desired inspected value must be created.
 
 @return The actual value inspected by the inspector.
